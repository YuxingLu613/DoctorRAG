          "answer": "Based on your symptoms of low back pain shooting down your legs, along with weakness and numbness in your legs, it sounds like you may be experiencing a condition known as Lumbar Disc Herniation. This occurs when the inner core of the disc in your spine leaks out and puts pressure on the nearby nerves, causing the symptoms you've described.\n\nIn terms of treatment, there are several approaches that can be considered. These include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) topical therapy, self-treatment such as specific exercises to strengthen the lumbar support system, non-surgical treatment including home remedies and medication, manual therapy, and minimally invasive treatment.\n\nI would recommend starting with non-surgical treatment methods, such as anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications, physical therapy, and possibly manual therapy to relieve muscle spasms and reduce discal pressure. If these methods do not provide relief, we can explore other options, including minimally invasive treatment. It's important to discuss these options further and create a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific condition and needs. It's also important to address any concerns or questions you may have about the treatment options."

Lifestyle adjustments such as maintaining a good posture, regular exercise to maintain joint flexibility, and avoiding heavy lifting are important. Additionally, pain relief and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs prescribed by a doctor can help reduce your discomfort.\n\nIt's important to seek a proper evaluation and diagnosis from a healthcare professional to confirm if you have ankylosing spondylitis and to discuss an appropriate treatment plan. I would advise you to schedule an appointment with a rheumatologist who can provide a comprehensive assessment and recommend personalized treatment options tailored to your specific needs."

      "reference_answer": "It sounds like you've been experiencing significant discomfort and a number of concerning symptoms including localized pain and swelling in your knee, fever, and loss of appetite. These symptoms could be indicative of a condition known as osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is an infection in the bone which can cause significant pain and systemic symptoms such as fever and loss of appetite.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, I would recommend conducting a thorough physical examination of the affected knee, as well as imaging studies such as an X-ray or MRI to assess the extent of the infection. Laboratory tests, including blood cultures, may also be necessary to identify the specific causative organism and determine the most appropriate antibiotic therapy.\n\nIf the diagnosis of osteomyelitis is confirmed, treatment typically involves a combination of surgical intervention to drain pus and remove necrotic tissue, as well as high-dose antibiotic therapy. The surgical procedure aims to expose the infection to air and remove any affected tissue. Antibiotic therapy, typically with penicillin, is administered at a high dosage for several months to effectively combat the infection. Supportive care is also essential, especially if the patient's general condition is poor.\n\nIt's important to seek prompt medical attention for this condition, as untreated osteomyelitis can lead to serious complications. I recommend scheduling an appointment with an orthopedic specialist who can conduct a thorough evaluation and determine the most appropriate course of treatment for you.
