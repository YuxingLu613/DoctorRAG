I don't feel good at all.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any swelling or tenderness in your lymph nodes, such as those in your neck, armpits, or groin?\nPatient: Yes, I have noticed some swelling in my neck and armpit areas.",
  "reference_answer": "It sounds like you may be experiencing a condition called Erysipelas, which is characterized by a high fever, shivering, red skin, and swollen lymph nodes. The recommended treatment involves clearing heat and detoxifying to manage the symptoms. It's important to seek medical attention for a proper evaluation and treatment plan.",
  "answers": {
    "Stage 1 Original Answer (Input to Med-TextGrad)": "It sounds like you may be experiencing erysipelas or acute cellulitis. Both conditions can cause high fever, shivering, diffuse skin erythema, and lymph node swelling. Erysipelas typically presents with a more sharply demarcated red area, while cellulitis involves deeper tissue layers and can be more diffuse.\n\nImmediate medical attention is crucial. We need to perform diagnostic tests, including blood cultures and possibly a skin biopsy, to confirm the infection and identify the causative agent. Treatment will likely involve antibiotics, possibly intravenous if the infection is severe. Rest, hydration, and pain management are also important.\n\nHave you noticed any recent cuts, insect bites, or other skin injuries? This information can help pinpoint the source of the infection. Please seek medical care promptly to start appropriate treatment and prevent complications.",
    "Med-TextGrad Initial Refinement (A0_refined)": "Based on your symptoms—high fever, shivering, diffuse skin redness, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits—you may have a bacterial skin infection such as erysipelas or cellulitis. These conditions often present with fever, chills, skin erythema, and regional lymph node involvement. \n\nGiven the severity of your symptoms, urgent medical evaluation is necessary. Diagnostic tests like blood work and wound cultures may be needed to confirm the infection and guide antibiotic therapy. Treatment typically involves oral or intravenous antibiotics, depending on severity, along with supportive care like rest and hydration. \n\nPotential complications include abscess formation or systemic infection if untreated. Please visit a healthcare facility immediately for proper assessment and treatment. Have you had any recent skin breaks, wounds, or insect bites that could have introduced infection? This information would be helpful for diagnosis.",
    "Med-TextGrad Final Refined Answer (AT)": "\"I understand this is worrying, so prompt care is vital. Your high fever, chills, widespread skin redness, and swollen lymph nodes suggest a bacterial skin infection like cellulitis (diffuse swelling) or erysipelas (sharp-edged redness). While rare, severe infections like necrotizing fasciitis require immediate attention if you develop rapidly worsening pain, dark skin changes, or dizziness. Seek care today for blood tests and IV antibiotics. While awaiting care, note if the redness spreads or becomes more painful. Go to a healthcare facility now.\""

      "input_answer": "It sounds like you may be experiencing erysipelas or acute cellulitis. Both conditions can cause high fever, shivering, diffuse skin erythema, and lymph node swelling. Erysipelas typically presents with a more sharply demarcated red area, while cellulitis involves deeper tissue layers and can be more diffuse.\n\nImmediate medical attention is crucial. We need to perform diagnostic tests, including blood cultures and possibly a skin biopsy, to confirm the infection and identify the causative agent. Treatment will likely involve antibiotics, possibly intravenous if the infection is severe. Rest, hydration, and pain management are also important.\n\nHave you noticed any recent cuts, insect bites, or other skin injuries? This information can help pinpoint the source of the infection.

These conditions often present with fever, chills, skin erythema, and regional lymph node involvement. \n\nGiven the severity of your symptoms, urgent medical evaluation is necessary. Diagnostic tests like blood work and wound cultures may be needed to confirm the infection and guide antibiotic therapy. Treatment typically involves oral or intravenous antibiotics, depending on severity, along with supportive care like rest and hydration. \n\nPotential complications include abscess formation or systemic infection if untreated.

Ensure key findings (e.g., leukocytosis, lymph node involvement) are explicitly addressed or justified.\n   - If symptoms (e.g., high fever, erythema) overlap with severe conditions in the context (e.g., necrotizing fasciitis), briefly note the need to rule them out.\n   - Exclude diagnoses not supported by the patient’s symptoms or context (e.g., omit pemphigus without vesicles/bullae or osteomyelitis without bone pain).\n   - Mention relevant diagnostic findings (e.g., leukocytosis) when they are listed in the context for the suspected conditions.\n   - Do not include complications (e.g., laryngeal edema) unless the patient describes corresponding symptoms.\n\n2. **Patient-Centered Language & Clarity:**\n   - Use clear, simple terms (e.g., \"redness\" instead of \"erythema\").\n   - Acknowledge distress with brief empathy early in the answer (e.g., \"I understand this is concerning\").\n   - Incorporate relevant demographic details (e.g., \"At your age, hormonal factors may...\") where clinically appropriate.\n   - Simplify follow-up questions to essential elements (e.g., \"Any recent skin breaks or insect bites?\").\n   - Replace medical jargon in complication warnings with plain language (e.g., \"could worsen or spread\" instead of \"systemic infection\").\n\n3. **Urgency & Actionability:**\n   - Convert vague urgency terms (\"urgent evaluation\") to specific patient instructions (\"seek care today\").\n   - Highlight urgency and immediate interventions (e.g., IV antibiotics for systemic infection) when supported by the context.\n   - Provide specific action timing (e.g., \"visit a healthcare facility today\").\n\n4. **Structure & Flow:**\n   - Maintain the original structure (symptoms → diagnoses → urgency → diagnostics/treatment → complications → history) but ensure each section incorporates contextually relevant details.\n   - Ensure logical transitions between sections (e.g., link fever/redness to infection, then to diagnostics/treatment).\n\n5. **Validation:**\n   - After refinement, verify all critical clinical details from the original answer are preserved unchanged.\n   - Ensure the refined answer is factually sound, clear, and directly addresses the patient's query.\n\n**Output Requirements:**\n- Output ONLY the refined medical answer itself, without any conversational preamble, meta-commentary, self-correction notes, or any text other than the refined answer.\n- The refined answer must be empathetic, concise, and actionable while preserving clinical accuracy.\n\n**Example Patient Query (q) for Context:**\nPatient: I'm a 35-year-old woman and I've been feeling really unwell. I have a high fever, I'm shivering and I noticed my skin is all red. I don't feel good at all.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any swelling or tenderness in your lymph nodes, such as those in your neck, armpits, or groin?\nPatient: Yes, I have noticed some swelling in my neck and armpit areas.\n\n**Supporting Context (C) (excerpt for guiding refinement):**\n--- General Medical Knowledge (Expertise) ---\nErysipelas: Convulsions, chills, high fever, diffuse skin erythema, and leukocytosis\nAcute Cellulitis: Skin and soft tissue infections, diffuse erythema and swelling of the skin, pain, chills, fever, headache, fatigue, leukocytosis, high fever, convulsions, delirium, laryngeal edema\nNecrotizing Fasciitis: Necrotizing fasciitis, diffuse erythema of the skin, cellulitis, fascial pain, edema, chills, high fever, anorexia, dehydration, disturbance of consciousness, hypotension, jaundice\nPemphigus: Mucosal lesions, diffuse erythema and swelling of the skin, vesicles or bullae lesions\n\n--- Retrieved Patient Cases (Experience) ---\nRetrieved Patient Case (ID: patient_40):\n  Patient's Query in Case: N/A\n  Case-Specific Information/Context: N/A\n  Diagnosis in Case: N/A\n  Advice/Treatment in Case: N/A\n  Recorded Answer in Case: Based on the symptoms you've described, it's possible that you may have osteomyelitis, which is an infection in the bone.

      "input_answer": "Based on your symptoms—high fever, shivering, diffuse skin redness, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits—you may have a bacterial skin infection such as erysipelas or cellulitis. These conditions often present with fever, chills, skin erythema, and regional lymph node involvement. \n\nGiven the severity of your symptoms, urgent medical evaluation is necessary. Diagnostic tests like blood work and wound cultures may be needed to confirm the infection and guide antibiotic therapy. Treatment typically involves oral or intravenous antibiotics, depending on severity, along with supportive care like rest and hydration. \n\nPotential complications include abscess formation or systemic infection if untreated. Please visit a healthcare facility immediately for proper assessment and treatment. Have you had any recent skin breaks, wounds, or insect bites that could have introduced infection?

      "gradient_prompt_knowledge": "**Improved Prompt (P) Guidelines for Knowledge Integration & Accuracy:**  \n\n1. **Symptom Alignment:**  \n   - Explicitly instruct the LLM to include only symptoms directly supported by the context (e.g., fever, chills, skin redness, leukocytosis) and exclude unsupported details (e.g., swollen lymph nodes).  \n   - Mandate verification of all symptoms against authoritative medical sources for the specified conditions (cellulitis, erysipelas, necrotizing fasciitis).  \n\n2. **Severe Condition Red Flags:**  \n   - Require explicit mention of severe but less likely conditions (e.g., necrotizing fasciitis) with contextually accurate red flags (e.g., rapid worsening, hypotension, disturbance of consciousness, dark skin changes).  \n   - Include severe complications of common diagnoses (e.g., delirium or laryngeal edema for cellulitis) when supported by context.  \n\n3. **Diagnostic Findings:**  \n   - Direct the LLM to incorporate relevant diagnostic markers (e.g., leukocytosis) when logically aligned with the described symptoms.  \n   - Prohibit inclusion of unsupported differentials (e.g., pemphigus without vesicles/bullae).  \n\n4. **Urgency & Actionability:**  \n   - Maintain the urgency structure but ensure it is driven by contextually severe symptoms (e.g., leukocytosis, systemic signs) rather than unsupported details.  \n   - Explicitly forbid irrelevant treatments (e.g., herbal remedies, surgical interventions) unless directly tied to the diagnosis.  \n\n5. **Factual Verification:**  \n   - Require cross-checking all medical claims against authoritative sources to prevent misrepresentation.  \n   - Emphasize strict adherence to context-backed severity indicators and avoid overemphasizing minor inconsistencies.  \n\n6. **Core Structure Preservation:**  \n   - Retain the original flow (empathy → differentials → urgency → action steps) but refine symptom lists and red flags to align strictly with the context.  \n\n**Key Additions to Prompt (P):**  \n- Add: \"Exclude symptoms not explicitly listed in the context (e.g., swollen lymph nodes for cellulitis/erysipelas).\"  \n- Add: \"Include leukocytosis as a supporting finding for bacterial skin infections when fever/chills are present.\"  \n- Add: \"Expand necrotizing fasciitis red flags to include hypotension and disturbance of consciousness.\"  \n- Add: \"Mention severe cellulitis complications (e.g., delirium, laryngeal edema) if systemic symptoms are present.\"  \n- Add: \"Do not reference pemphigus or unrelated treatments (e.g., surgery, herbal care) unless vesicles/bullae are described.\"",
      "gradient_prompt_patient": "**Improved Prompt (P) Modifications:**  \n\n1. **Enhance Relevance & Specificity in Guidelines:**  \n   - Add explicit instruction to link systemic symptoms (e.g., swollen lymph nodes) to the suspected diagnosis, clarifying their role as a common response to infection.  \n   - Include a directive to note when severe lymph node swelling may indicate broader infection, reinforcing urgency.  \n\n2. **Strengthen Empathy & Patient Validation:**  \n   - Mandate early empathetic acknowledgment (e.g., \"I hear how unwell you’re feeling\") in the response structure, alongside urgency.  \n   - Require validation of patient distress before clinical details.  \n\n3. **Expand Differential Diagnoses Guidance:**  \n   - Instruct the LLM to briefly mention less likely non-infectious causes (e.g., allergic reactions) when systemic symptoms overlap, followed by rationale for prioritizing infectious causes (e.g., fever).  \n   - Emphasize maintaining urgency for bacterial infections while acknowledging alternatives.  \n\n4. **Clarify Urgency Rationale:**  \n   - Add a directive to include a concise rationale for immediate care (e.g., \"because bacterial infections can worsen quickly without antibiotics\") alongside action steps.  \n\n5. **Preserve Structure with Added Nuance:**  \n   - Retain the original urgency and warning signs but integrate new elements (e.g., lymph node explanation, empathy) without redundancy.  \n   - Specify that additions should flow naturally and avoid overloading technical details.  \n\n6. **Balance Specificity & Simplicity:**  \n   - Explicitly state that added clarifications must be concise and use plain language (e.g., \"widespread infection\" instead of \"disseminated process\").  \n\n**Revised Prompt Section (Insert):**  \n- Under **Patient-Centered Language & Clarity**:  \n  - \"Open with empathetic validation (e.g., 'I hear how unwell you’re feeling') before clinical details.\"  \n- Under **Knowledge Integration & Accuracy**:  \n  - \"Explicitly link systemic symptoms (e.g., lymph node swelling) to the suspected diagnosis, noting their role in infection severity.\"  \n  - \"Briefly acknowledge less likely non-infectious causes if symptom overlap exists, but prioritize infectious etiologies when fever or systemic signs are present.\"  \n- Under **Urgency & Actionability**:  \n  - \"Include a brief rationale for urgency (e.g., 'because bacterial infections require prompt antibiotics to prevent worsening').\""
